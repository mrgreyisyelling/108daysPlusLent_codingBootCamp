I can tell whatever story I want about the last two decades, and I am not sure any of it matters. People will judge me, and it breaks my heart.

Good or bad, as that is, it is not who I wanted to be. I am here - because, I finally feel completed in some ache that came over me. I didn't win, in fact, arguably, I failed. Badly. But that didn't give me a sense of completion. 

Things have been taken off the table for good, and that is a reality that sobered me up to what is important to me. Prior to that, anxiety in my heart made anything and everything possible, but it also left me drawn in 40 different directions because I was trying to emotionally compete in all of it.

Thats not me anymore, though I am no less thoughtful. 

I have about 35 years left. I am watching my father age and I know that might be generous. Its late to be starting over, but I have no other choice at this point. And its not starting over, its just - it always felt like I never got started. The reason for that was simple, but I didn't realize how dishonest I had been. Things fell apart, finally, and it left me clear headed about what went wrong. 

There is sorrow - somethings have been lost that will never be back and there isn't anything to be said more about that. Whatever meaning that gives me, is private. Speaking about my internal world, is private. 

Being realistic, being sober in all things, is how it feels now. 

So I am writing this because I am at the end of a period where I gave myself a chance to re-orient, and I am glad that I had the time. In a few days I am going to return to a world and a space that I had left behind to do this. That place is chaotic, stressful and filled with people I have grown to hate and dislike. I am not leaving though. I am committing to my path in that space and I am going to overcome this confusion. 

Its not confusion, its just - there is a vagueness about me, that I have learned that is unwanted by certain class of people. I lack a certain sense of belonging, and because people lack definitions, they put me where they think I belong. I almost never enjoy that. Looking for work is an act of dress-up, and I hate that. 

If I don't do that - if I feel the need to work publically, in a messy way - like this repo, I am going to have to help people learn to figure me out. Because if they aren't given the tools necessary - they will just do what they normally do. 

Github fits my style, even if I might be doing something wrong using it this way. I am a messy first draft person. Professionalism is a question of practice, but my practice comes from the relentless manner in which I pursue certain ideas and habits. I am driven by my anxiety without a doubt, but it isn't pointless. It leads to constant searching and adapting. My problem, previously, is that I have hidden the messy. I have hundreds of documents, that I have worked on. When I was not sober - this didn't stop. My struggles with sobriety, at its heart, was a struggle with this fact. I was painfully aware, my way of doing things, didn't fit. 

So I hid them. Like I always do. 

This new time - I won't. And I know there will be consequences. Maybe I won't get a job, and maybe I will be forever stuck. But, I am not going to hope for anything else anymore. I have paid my dues, all the guilt and shame that motivated everything for the past 14 years. I'm done. That wasn't me, despite it being grounded in my bullshit. I knew myself once, and I knew someone else once. They are gone, I am still here. And professional or not, thats my only path forward. 

There is no reuniting with that part of me, without accepting what motivates me. There is no accepting myself, without enjoying and embracing myself. I struggle - as everyone struggles - but I punish myself. I hate myself, maybe like everyone does. 

Being professional means? Hiding this. Or not making it the first and only thing people see about you. Its about the work having been done, to a point, where what motivated you and the story that you are, falls away, and you are left with the work. I tried to invent myself from the work, and it killed me. Because of that, I am detached from the nature of who I am. That is not going to last long.

I will embrace the person I am, and the work that comes from it will be good. I am grateful for this life and what I have had seen. I am at peace, and with these 35 years, I hope to take my seat everyday, and work as hard as I have ever done, but for better reasons.
