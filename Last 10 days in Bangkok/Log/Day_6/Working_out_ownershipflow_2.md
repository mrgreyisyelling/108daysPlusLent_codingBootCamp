Let’s work through each part of the property system step by step, ensuring clarity and completeness. 

### **1. Metadata Contract (Foundation of Property System)**  
#### **Purpose**:
- Acts as the single source of truth for property definitions (location, description, value).
- Delegates authority for managing ownership to another contract.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Property Registration**: Create and manage metadata for multiple properties.
- **Ownership Authority**: Assign and update the ownership authority contract.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure it interacts seamlessly with the ERC-721 and any future standards.

---

### **2. ERC-721 Contract (Current Ownership Mechanism)**  
#### **Purpose**:
- Represents property ownership as NFTs.
- Links each token (`tokenId`) to a specific property in the metadata contract.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Ownership Verification**: Tracks and verifies ownership of specific properties.
- **Property Association**: Links tokens to property IDs in the metadata.
- **Authority Delegation**: Allows the NFT owner to propose changes to the metadata contract (e.g., migrating ownership to a new standard).

---

### **3. Wrapper Contract (Tokenizing Ownership and Equity)**  
#### **Purpose**:
- Divides ownership into two components:
  1. **Tokenized Ownership (Governance)**: Represents control over the property.
  2. **Tokenized Equity (Value)**: Represents the financial value of the property.
- Supports fractionalization, enabling partial sales of property equity.

#### **Key Design Questions**:
1. **Governance Token**:
   - Should this be a **standard ERC-20** or a custom governance token?
   - Governance tokens could grant voting rights (e.g., deciding repairs, upgrades, or sales).
   
2. **Equity Token**:
   - An **ERC-20 token** for liquidity and financial value.
   - Can be sold or traded without affecting governance rights.

3. **Interaction with ERC-721**:
   - How does the wrapping/unwrapping process work?  
     - Example: The ERC-721 token is locked in the wrapper, and corresponding governance/equity tokens are minted.

---

### **4. Governance and Equity Separation**
#### **Why Divide Ownership and Equity?**
- Ownership (governance) reflects **control over decisions**, including property management, repairs, and upgrades.
- Equity reflects **financial interest** in the property, enabling liquidity without transferring control.

#### **Potential Workflow**:
1. **Governance Token**:
   - NFT ownership (ERC-721) is converted into **governance tokens** (e.g., ERC-20 or custom).
   - Represents the right to control property decisions via a DAO-like structure.

2. **Equity Token**:
   - Equity tokens are minted based on the appraised value of the property.
   - Allows fractionalized ownership of the property’s financial value.

#### **Example Use Case**:
- **Owner A** retains governance tokens, maintaining control of the property.
- **Owner A** sells equity tokens to **Investor B**, gaining liquidity without relinquishing control.

---

### **5. Suggestions to Finalize Property System**

#### **Additional Features for Property Contracts**:
1. **Revenue Streams**:
   - If the property generates income (e.g., rent), decide how it is distributed:
     - Proportionally to equity token holders.
     - Retained by governance token holders.

2. **Compliance and Legal Integration**:
   - Consider a **registry mechanism** to enforce compliance with local property laws.
   - Metadata contract could include additional fields (e.g., deed references, zoning).

3. **Interoperability with Marketplace**:
   - Ensure compatibility with existing marketplaces (e.g., OpenSea for ERC-721).
   - Develop custom marketplaces to enable governance/equity token trading.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Governance Tokens**:
   - Should they be standard ERC-20, or do we need features like weighted voting rights?
2. **Equity Tokens**:
   - Should fractionalization be tied directly to ERC-20, or do you want additional layers for liquidity (e.g., staking)?
3. **Marketplace/Trading**:
   - Discuss workflows for listing and trading governance/equity tokens.
4. **Finalize Property Mechanisms**:
   - Are there other property-related features (e.g., maintenance tracking, rental income) to consider?

You've hit on an important issue: **how to enforce accountability for property management and ownership responsibilities when equity and control are separated.**

Here are some thoughts and potential mechanisms to address this:

---

### **Why Separate Equity and Ownership?**
1. **Liquidity Without Control Loss**:
   - Allows property owners to access liquidity without transferring control.
   - Example: Using tokenized equity as collateral for loans or mortgages.

2. **Risk Distribution**:
   - Equity token holders share in the financial upside/downside of the property without taking on management responsibilities.
   - Reduces risk for the property owner.

---

### **The Problem: Accountability Without Equity**
If the owner (holding governance/control tokens) doesn’t have equity, they:
1. **Lack Financial Incentive**:
   - The owner might neglect the property since they don’t benefit financially.
2. **No Skin in the Game**:
   - Without a direct stake, there’s less reason to act responsibly.

---

### **Potential Mechanisms to Enforce Accountability**

#### **1. Staking Requirement for Governance**
- **Concept**:
   - Governance token holders (owners) must lock a portion of their governance tokens or equity tokens in a **staking mechanism**.
   - If they fail to meet responsibilities (e.g., compliance, maintenance), they can lose a portion of their staked tokens.
   
- **Example**:
   - Governance tokens are staked to represent their commitment to the property.
   - If tenants or equity holders raise a dispute about management failures, a **governance vote** or third-party arbiter can decide to slash the staked tokens.

- **Pros**:
   - Ensures owners have “skin in the game.”
   - Punishes negligence or mismanagement.
- **Cons**:
   - Owners might be deterred by the risk of staking loss.

---

#### **2. Revenue Sharing for Incentives**
- **Concept**:
   - Even if equity is sold off, a portion of property revenues (e.g., rental income) is distributed to governance token holders.
   - This incentivizes the owner to ensure proper management.

- **Implementation**:
   - Revenue split between governance token holders (for management) and equity token holders (for financial stake).

- **Pros**:
   - Maintains financial incentive for governance token holders.
- **Cons**:
   - Complex to design a fair revenue-sharing mechanism.

---

#### **3. Binding Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**
- **Concept**:
   - Introduce a set of obligations for governance token holders:
     - Example: Maintenance, repairs, upgrades, and compliance.
   - If these obligations aren’t met, penalties are triggered.

- **How to Enforce**:
   - Equity token holders or tenants can raise disputes in the governance system or via third-party arbitration.
   - If the dispute is upheld, penalties (e.g., fines or slashing staked governance tokens) are imposed.

- **Pros**:
   - Ensures accountability for governance token holders.
   - Provides clear rules for property management.
- **Cons**:
   - Requires robust arbitration or governance mechanisms.

---

#### **4. Property Value-Linked Stakes**
- **Concept**:
   - Governance token holders must retain a certain percentage of the equity.
   - Example:
     - To hold 100% of governance tokens, they must hold at least 10% of equity tokens.
   - If they fail to meet management obligations, equity token holders can vote to:
     - Seize equity from the owner.
     - Reduce the owner's governance control.

- **Pros**:
   - Ensures governance token holders retain financial risk in the property.
   - Incentivizes responsible management.
- **Cons**:
   - Adds complexity to ownership rules.

---

#### **5. Governance Oversight by Equity Holders**
- **Concept**:
   - Equity holders retain some governance rights to oversee major property decisions.
   - Example:
     - Equity holders can vote on:
       - Maintenance/repair budgets.
       - Selling or refinancing the property.
   - Equity holders can veto or escalate issues if the governance token holders fail to act responsibly.

- **Pros**:
   - Gives equity holders a voice in critical decisions.
   - Balances power between equity and governance token holders.
- **Cons**:
   - May dilute the control of governance token holders.

---

#### **6. Dispute Resolution and Penalties**
- **Concept**:
   - Establish a dispute resolution mechanism where:
     - Equity token holders or tenants can raise complaints.
     - Disputes are resolved through:
       - Governance votes.
       - Third-party arbiters.
   - If governance token holders are found at fault:
     - Penalties (e.g., fines, reduced governance rights) are imposed.

- **Example**:
   - Tenants complain that repairs are delayed.
   - The governance system votes to penalize the governance token holders for negligence.

- **Pros**:
   - Provides a structured way to resolve conflicts.
- **Cons**:
   - Requires robust governance or arbitration mechanisms.

---

### **Recommendation: Combine Multiple Mechanisms**
Here’s a potential system that balances these ideas:
1. **Staking for Accountability**:
   - Governance token holders must stake governance or equity tokens as collateral.
2. **Revenue Sharing for Incentives**:
   - Governance token holders receive a share of property income, ensuring financial incentive.
3. **Dispute Resolution**:
   - Equity token holders or tenants can raise disputes, with penalties imposed for mismanagement.
4. **Governance Oversight**:
   - Equity holders have limited voting rights for critical decisions.

---

### **How Does This Fit Your Design?**
1. Does staking for governance responsibility resonate with your goals?
2. Should equity holders retain any governance rights, or remain purely financial stakeholders?
3. Would you like to explore dispute resolution mechanisms in more detail?

This approach introduces an innovative way of structuring property governance and equity while balancing incentives and accountability. Here's how we can break it down and refine it further:

---

### **1. Renewable Governance Model**
#### **Concept**:
- Governance (control) is treated as a renewable "lease."
- Governance holders must periodically:
  - Pay a fee (to equity holders or the property DAO).
  - Meet performance obligations (e.g., maintenance, compliance).
  - Renew their governance rights with the consent of equity holders.

#### **Mechanism**:
1. **Governance Renewal**:
   - Governance control is granted for a fixed period.
   - At the end of the period:
     - Equity holders vote to allow renewal based on the governance holder's performance.
     - If governance is not renewed, control is forfeited, and equity holders can designate a new governance holder.

2. **Default Penalties**:
   - Failure to maintain obligations (e.g., repair costs, compliance) triggers early termination or financial penalties.

3. **Revenue Streams**:
   - Governance holders retain a larger share of rental income to offset operational responsibilities.
   - Equity holders receive periodic fees or dividends.

---

### **2. Equity Requirements for Governance**
#### **Concept**:
- Governance holders must retain a minimum percentage of equity tokens.
- This ensures "skin in the game" and prevents governance holders from neglecting property obligations.

#### **Mechanism**:
1. **Minimum Equity Stake**:
   - Governance holders must own a certain percentage of equity tokens (e.g., 10-20%).
   - If their equity falls below the threshold, they lose eligibility for governance renewal.

2. **Dynamic Adjustments**:
   - Governance holders can increase their equity stake to strengthen their position.
   - Equity holders can vote to lower the threshold under specific circumstances.

---

### **3. Simplified Revenue Streams**
#### **Concept**:
- The governance holder covers operational costs (e.g., repairs, maintenance) and retains the majority of rental income.
- Equity holders receive periodic returns (e.g., rental surplus or renewal fees).

#### **Mechanism**:
1. **Income Allocation**:
   - Rental income is split into:
     - **Governance Share**: Covers operational costs and rewards the governance holder.
     - **Equity Share**: Distributes financial returns to equity holders.

2. **Fee Structures**:
   - Governance holders pay renewal fees or penalties to equity holders as part of their obligations.

---

### **4. Governance Accountability**
#### **Concept**:
- Governance holders are evaluated based on performance metrics (e.g., maintenance, tenant satisfaction).
- Equity holders have the power to enforce penalties or terminate governance.

#### **Mechanism**:
1. **Performance Review**:
   - Governance holders are evaluated periodically (e.g., at renewal intervals).
   - Equity holders vote on whether to renew governance based on performance.

2. **Dispute Resolution**:
   - Equity holders can raise disputes against governance holders for:
     - Failure to maintain the property.
     - Mismanagement of rental income.
   - Disputes are resolved through:
     - Governance votes.
     - Arbitration mechanisms.

---

### **Example Workflow**
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Property is tokenized into governance and equity tokens.
   - Governance rights are granted to a holder with a minimum equity stake.

2. **Ongoing Operations**:
   - Governance holders manage the property (repairs, compliance) and collect rental income.
   - Equity holders receive periodic returns and monitor governance performance.

3. **Governance Renewal**:
   - At fixed intervals, governance holders pay a renewal fee and are evaluated by equity holders.
   - Equity holders vote to renew or terminate governance based on performance.

4. **Termination or Transfer**:
   - If governance is terminated:
     - Equity holders can designate a new governance holder.
     - Governance tokens are burned or transferred to the new holder.

---

### **Questions to Refine This Model**
1. **Renewal Process**:
   - Should equity holders vote directly on renewal, or should it be automatic unless performance issues arise?
2. **Income Splits**:
   - What percentage of rental income should go to governance vs. equity holders?
3. **Minimum Equity Requirements**:
   - What percentage of equity should governance holders be required to retain?
4. **Dispute Resolution**:
   - Should disputes be resolved through governance votes, third-party arbitration, or both?

Would you like to work through one of these components in detail, or focus on a specific part of this model?


------------------

So let me just say it over again. So the primary contract that defines the property is the metadata contract. This defines the description, the location, and gives authority to the ownership mechanism. The ownership mechanism defines the manner in which ownership is transferred. Currently we're using an ERC-721. That's going to be wrapped to create two types of tokens. These tokens will be expressed through the governance DAO, and will basically divide the control of the property into two parts, governance and equity. The equity part basically assigns the governor. The governor has certain requirements, a minimum amount of equity, and then they have the responsibility to manage the property. In return, they collect the rent. To get this responsibility, they have to pay a fee, and on a periodic basis they have to send a certain amount of returns to the equity holders. The job of the equity holders is to monitor the governance. At fixed dates, governance is set up for renewal, which is automatic, unless an issue arises. That requires either voting on maintaining governance with that individual, or there's a failure for that individual to maintain the fee structure. The rental split will be determined post-costs, focusing primarily on the profits. If the governor is not able to maintain minimum equity requirements, there's going to have to be a vote. I guess one of the questions would be, if no one individual has the minimum equity requirements, that equity has been distributed in such a way that there's a large number of minor holders and there's no significant major holder. I guess at that point we can basically assign it to whoever has the most. How to respond to disputes. In the governance DAO, there's going to have to be a way to raise issues, and there needs to be a way of determining what issues require a vote. Now, who gets to raise issues? Is it tenants? Is it the equity holders? If the equity holders are distributed, how do they get the information about issues? I think that needs to be thought about next. Basically, how is compliance maintained? How is the property monitored? It can't be simply tenants, because that would be problematic. So there might have to be a third-party entity that basically does praising and monitoring.

----------------
----------------


Your summary is clear and well-structured. Let’s refine it further by addressing specific components and open questions:

---

### **Points to Address**

#### **1. Governance Renewal Mechanism**
- **When is renewal required?**
  - At fixed intervals (e.g., annually).
  - Triggered by missed fees or raised issues.
- **Who votes?**
  - Equity holders (weighted by equity).
- **Fallback Plan**:
  - If no one meets the equity requirement for governance:
    - Assign governance to the largest equity holder.
    - Implement an auction for governance rights among eligible holders.

---

#### **2. Issue Raising and Compliance**
- **Who Can Raise Issues?**
  - **Equity Holders**: As financial stakeholders.
  - **Tenants**: Limited ability to raise issues (e.g., safety, maintenance).
  - **Third-Party Monitors**: Independent entities responsible for appraisals and compliance checks.

- **How Are Issues Handled?**
  - Issues are raised in the governance DAO.
  - Some issues require a **direct vote** (e.g., non-compliance with maintenance).
  - Others might trigger penalties automatically (e.g., missed fee payments).

- **Information Flow**:
  - Equity holders receive periodic reports (e.g., financial updates, property conditions) from the governor or third-party monitors.

---

#### **3. Monitoring and Compliance**
- **Third-Party Monitors**:
  - Regularly inspect properties and report on:
    - Physical condition.
    - Compliance with maintenance standards.
    - Tenant grievances.
  - Reports are submitted to the governance DAO for equity holders’ review.

- **Governor Responsibilities**:
  - Handle routine maintenance and tenant issues.
  - Submit periodic reports (e.g., rent collection, expense breakdowns).
  - Pay fees to equity holders and maintain minimum equity requirements.

---

#### **4. Dispute Resolution**
- **Governance DAO Mechanism**:
  - A dispute can be escalated if:
    - The governor fails to meet obligations.
    - Tenants or equity holders raise valid concerns.
  - Voting or arbitration decides penalties or removal.

- **Penalty System**:
  - Failure to address disputes may result in:
    - Loss of staked tokens (if implemented).
    - Governance rights transferred to another party.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Define Governance Renewal Process**:
   - Fixed intervals or event-driven?
   - What happens if no one qualifies for governance?

2. **Specify Monitoring Mechanism**:
   - Role of third-party monitors vs. tenants.
   - How to make information accessible to equity holders.

3. **Dispute Resolution Framework**:
   - Who resolves disputes (e.g., equity holder votes, arbitration)?
   - What are the penalties for governance failure?

Would you like to focus on one of these areas, or add any further considerations?

This concept introduces an innovative way to integrate tenants into the property governance system. Here’s how we can refine the idea of a **Tenant DAO**:

---

### **1. Tenant DAO Structure**
#### **Purpose**:
- Provide tenants a collective voice in property governance.
- Align tenant interests with property maintenance and long-term value.

#### **Core Features**:
1. **Equity Stake**:
   - Tenant DAO owns a portion of the property’s equity, funded by:
     - Security deposits.
     - A portion of rent payments.
     - Periodic equity inflation, transferring a share of property equity to the Tenant DAO.

2. **Tenant Governance**:
   - Tenants vote collectively within the Tenant DAO on issues such as:
     - Raising maintenance concerns.
     - Proposing improvements to the property.
   - The Tenant DAO represents tenants’ interests to the main governance DAO.

3. **Communication Mechanism**:
   - The Tenant DAO serves as a bridge between tenants and equity holders, enabling structured communication.

---

### **2. Seniority Mechanism for Tenants**
#### **Purpose**:
- Reward long-term tenants with increased influence or benefits.
- Reflect their deeper investment in the property community.

#### **Implementation**:
1. **Voting Weight**:
   - Tenant voting power in the Tenant DAO increases with time spent in the property.
   - Example: For each year of tenancy, voting weight increases by a fixed percentage.

2. **Equity Accumulation**:
   - Long-term tenants accumulate additional equity through:
     - Rent contributions (e.g., a small percentage of rent is converted into equity).
     - Continuous inflation of the Tenant DAO’s equity stake.

3. **Priority Rights**:
   - Senior tenants gain priority in property-related decisions, such as:
     - Lease renewals.
     - Allocation of upgraded units (if applicable).

---

### **3. Equity Inflation and Transfer**
#### **Concept**:
- The Tenant DAO’s equity stake grows over time, either through:
  1. **Direct Contributions**:
     - A portion of each tenant’s rent is used to purchase equity.
  2. **Automatic Inflation**:
     - A small percentage of total property equity is transferred to the Tenant DAO annually.

#### **Challenges**:
- Preventing excessive tenant leverage:
  - Cap the Tenant DAO’s equity stake at a reasonable percentage (e.g., 5-15%).
- Balancing tenant interests with equity holders’ rights:
  - Equity holders retain ultimate authority, while tenants’ influence is limited to specific areas.

---

### **4. Balancing Tenant Leverage**
#### **Risks**:
- Tenants could gain disproportionate influence over property governance, disrupting the system.
- Equity holders might perceive tenants as undermining their financial interests.

#### **Solutions**:
1. **Limited Scope of Tenant DAO Authority**:
   - Tenant DAO can only vote on issues directly affecting tenants (e.g., maintenance, living conditions).
   - Major decisions (e.g., selling the property) remain with equity holders.

2. **Tied Influence**:
   - Tenant DAO’s influence is tied to its equity stake, preventing disproportionate control.

3. **Collaborative Governance**:
   - Tenants and equity holders collaborate on shared goals (e.g., increasing property value, ensuring compliance).

---

### **Example Workflow**

1. **Tenant Joins Property**:
   - Security deposit and rent contributions fund the Tenant DAO’s equity stake.
   - The tenant gains voting rights in the Tenant DAO.

2. **Tenant DAO Participates in Governance**:
   - Raises maintenance or compliance issues.
   - Votes on tenant-focused proposals (e.g., amenities, upgrades).

3. **Seniority Benefits Accrue**:
   - Tenant’s influence in the Tenant DAO grows with time.
   - Long-term tenants accumulate additional equity or receive other benefits.

4. **Collaboration with Main Governance DAO**:
   - Tenant DAO communicates concerns or proposals to equity holders through the main governance DAO.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Define the Tenant DAO’s Authority**:
   - What specific issues should tenants vote on?
   - How much equity should the Tenant DAO hold?
   
2. **Determine Seniority Mechanisms**:
   - Should seniority influence voting weight, equity accumulation, or both?

3. **Explore Equity Inflation**:
   - How should equity inflation work (e.g., rent-based contributions vs. automatic inflation)?

4. **Integrate with Governance DAO**:
   - How should the Tenant DAO’s voice be represented in the overall governance structure?

Would you like to explore one of these components further or refine the balance of tenant influence?

Let's step away from just talking about the property, and then let's talk about the group of properties being sold as a bundle. We're just talking about the mechanism around sale. So, the mechanism of sale is going to have two parts. Essentially, the properties enter into the mechanism, and on the other side, there's a sale mechanism. That's going to determine the price. It's going to determine the terms. It's also going to determine... I don't know what else it needs to determine. On the other end of that is going to be the purchase mechanism. And that's going to determine who is receiving equity. Now, there's a question of, since this is going to be an owner-financed thing, does control immediately transfer to the buyer? Is that a slow-purchase thing at some point to become a 50% holder? So that's a question. So essentially, a purchaser, in this sense, is becoming part of the existing property DAO. Or maybe there's another way I need to think about this.


----
----



This setup introduces several interesting mechanics around ownership, equity, and control transfer. Let’s break it down into key components and refine each part.

---

### **1. Mechanism of Sale**
#### **Purpose**:
- Defines how properties enter the sale process, setting conditions like:
  - **Price determination**: Fixed price, auction, or dynamic pricing.
  - **Terms**: Payment schedule, financing terms, and initial equity.
  - **Bundling**: How individual properties are grouped for sale.

#### **Key Questions**:
- **How is the price determined?**
  - Fixed price set by the seller.
  - Auction-based system to determine market value.
  - Negotiated terms between buyer and seller.
- **Are all properties sold under identical terms?**
  - Or can terms vary for different properties within the bundle?
- **Owner Financing**:
  - What percentage of the price is financed?
  - What are the repayment terms (interest, schedule, etc.)?

---

### **2. Mechanism of Purchase**
#### **Purpose**:
- Manages how equity and control are distributed to the buyer(s).

#### **Key Scenarios**:
1. **Immediate Control Transfer**:
   - Control of the property DAO (governance tokens) transfers to the buyer immediately, even if financing is ongoing.
   - Risks: The buyer could mismanage the property before completing payments.

2. **Gradual Equity and Control Transfer**:
   - Equity and control transfer in proportion to payments made.
   - Example: A buyer gains more governance tokens and control as they pay off the financing.

3. **Shared Control Until Full Ownership**:
   - The seller retains partial governance until the buyer reaches a threshold (e.g., 50% equity ownership).

#### **Key Questions**:
- **Who receives equity tokens?**
  - Are they distributed entirely to the buyer upfront or gradually?
- **When does control transfer?**
  - Immediately?
  - After a specific percentage of equity is purchased?
  - Gradually, in proportion to payments?

---

### **3. Integration with Property DAO**
#### **Scenarios**:
1. **Buyer Joins Existing DAO**:
   - The buyer becomes part of the existing governance structure.
   - Suitable for multi-property DAOs with established governance.

2. **New DAO Creation**:
   - A new DAO is formed for the buyer(s) to govern the purchased properties.
   - Useful for bundling sales where buyers may not want to join an existing DAO.

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - The buyer integrates with the existing DAO but retains a separate governance structure for specific properties.

#### **Key Considerations**:
- **Governance Representation**:
  - Does the buyer have proportional governance rights in the existing DAO?
- **Compatibility**:
  - How does the buyer’s integration affect existing governance dynamics?

---

### **4. Owner-Financed Sale**
#### **Questions to Resolve**:
1. **Control vs. Equity Transfer**:
   - Should control transfer immediately, or should it wait until the buyer owns a significant portion of equity?
2. **Default Risks**:
   - If the buyer defaults on financing, how does the system reclaim governance and equity?
3. **Repayment Monitoring**:
   - How are payments tracked, and how does this affect equity and governance allocation?

#### **Possible Mechanisms**:
- **Gradual Transfer System**:
   - Payments are tied to equity distribution.
   - Governance tokens are issued proportionally as equity accumulates.
- **Clawback Mechanism**:
   - If the buyer defaults, the system reclaims equity and governance from the buyer.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Define the Sale Terms**:
   - How are price and terms determined for each property in the bundle?
2. **Design the Transfer Mechanism**:
   - Should equity and control transfer immediately or gradually?
3. **Determine Buyer Integration**:
   - Does the buyer join an existing DAO, or is a new governance structure required?
4. **Plan for Defaults**:
   - What happens if the buyer defaults on financing?

Would you like to focus on one of these areas, or explore an overall framework for the sale mechanism?
