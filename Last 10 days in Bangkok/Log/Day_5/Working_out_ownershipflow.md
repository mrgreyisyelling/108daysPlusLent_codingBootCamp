Great question! The **metadata contract itself doesn’t directly know** which individual owns the NFT. Instead, the **current ownership authority contract** (e.g., the ERC-721 contract) verifies that the caller owns the relevant NFT and informs the metadata contract.

Here’s how this works step by step:

---

### **1. Ownership Authority Contract Verifies Ownership**
The **current ownership authority contract** (e.g., ERC-721) implements a function like `verifyOwnership`, which checks:
- Whether the caller owns the specific NFT (`tokenId`) representing the property.

The **metadata contract** trusts this ownership authority to correctly validate ownership.

---

### **2. Workflow to Propose a Change in Authority**

1. **Caller Initiates a Change**:
   - The individual (current NFT owner) calls the **ERC-721 contract** to request an ownership authority change in the **metadata contract**.

2. **ERC-721 Verifies Ownership**:
   - The ERC-721 contract validates the caller’s ownership of the NFT (`ownerOf(tokenId)`).

3. **ERC-721 Calls Metadata Contract**:
   - Once ownership is verified, the ERC-721 contract (as the designated authority) calls the **metadata contract’s `proposeOwnershipAuthorityChange`** function.

4. **Metadata Contract Updates Authority**:
   - The metadata contract allows this update because it trusts the current ownership authority to have already verified ownership.

---

### **Example Flow**

#### **Step 1: Individual Initiates Authority Change**

The NFT owner interacts with the ERC-721 contract:
```solidity
contract PropertyOwnership is ERC721 {
    mapping(uint256 => address) public propertyMetadataContracts; // Maps tokenId to metadata contract

    // Function for NFT owner to propose authority change
    function proposeAuthorityChange(uint256 tokenId, address newAuthority) public {
        require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Caller is not the owner of the token");

        // Get the metadata contract linked to this tokenId
        address metadataContract = propertyMetadataContracts[tokenId];

        // Call the metadata contract to propose authority change
        PropertyMetadata(metadataContract).proposeOwnershipAuthorityChange(tokenId, newAuthority);
    }
}
```

---

#### **Step 2: Metadata Contract Accepts Authority Update**

The **metadata contract** trusts the current authority (ERC-721) to validate ownership. It checks only that the caller is the current authority:

```solidity
contract PropertyMetadata {
    struct Metadata {
        string location;
        string description;
        uint256 appraisedValue;
        address ownershipAuthority; // Current ownership authority contract
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Metadata) public properties;

    // Modifier to ensure only the current authority can call
    modifier onlyCurrentAuthority(uint256 propertyId) {
        require(
            msg.sender == properties[propertyId].ownershipAuthority,
            "Caller is not the current ownership authority"
        );
        _;
    }

    // Function to update ownership authority
    function proposeOwnershipAuthorityChange(uint256 propertyId, address newAuthority) public onlyCurrentAuthority(propertyId) {
        // Update the ownership authority
        properties[propertyId].ownershipAuthority = newAuthority;
        emit OwnershipAuthorityUpdated(propertyId, newAuthority);
    }
}
```

---

### **Why This Works**

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - The **metadata contract** delegates ownership verification to the **current ownership authority** (ERC-721).
   - The ERC-721 contract, as the trusted authority, ensures only the rightful NFT owner can trigger changes.

2. **Direct NFT Owner Control**:
   - Only the NFT owner can call the ERC-721 contract’s `proposeAuthorityChange` function.
   - The metadata contract never directly interacts with individual users—it relies on the authority.

3. **Security**:
   - The metadata contract ensures that only the designated authority can propose changes.
   - The ERC-721 contract ensures only the true NFT owner can call it.

---

### **How Does the Metadata Contract Know the NFT Owner?**

The metadata contract itself does not directly know. Instead:
1. The **current authority (e.g., ERC-721)** acts as the gatekeeper.
2. The NFT owner interacts with the authority.
3. The authority interacts with the metadata contract, verifying ownership on behalf of the NFT owner.

---

### **Why Not Let Metadata Contract Interact Directly with the Owner?**

This would:
- Break the modular design by coupling the metadata contract to the ERC-721 implementation.
- Require the metadata contract to understand NFT ownership rules, limiting its compatibility with new standards.

----------------------------
--------------------------

Yes, we can achieve this by designing a **standardized interface and base contract** that all future ownership contracts (including ERC-721) can inherit. This ensures:

1. **Consistency**: Any contract designated as an ownership authority must implement the same standardized logic.
2. **Modularity**: The metadata contract interacts with any ownership authority using a unified interface, ensuring compatibility with future ownership standards.
3. **Encapsulation**: Only the ownership contract knows who has the right to make changes (e.g., based on NFT ownership in ERC-721).

Here’s how we can structure this:

---

### **1. Define a Standardized Interface**
The interface specifies:
- How the metadata contract queries ownership.
- How the ownership authority contract makes callbacks to propose changes.

#### **Ownership Authority Interface**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IOwnershipAuthority {
    // Verify ownership of a propertyId
    function verifyOwnership(uint256 propertyId, address caller) external view returns (bool);

    // Execute an authority change in the metadata contract
    function proposeAuthorityChange(uint256 propertyId, address newAuthority) external;
}
```

---

### **2. Create a Base Contract**
A base contract provides shared logic for interacting with the metadata contract, ensuring all future ownership authorities (e.g., ERC-721, ERC-XYZ) can inherit it.

#### **Ownership Base Contract**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./IOwnershipAuthority.sol";

abstract contract OwnershipBase is IOwnershipAuthority {
    mapping(uint256 => address) public propertyMetadataContracts; // Links propertyId to metadata contracts

    // Modifier to check ownership for a given property
    modifier onlyPropertyOwner(uint256 propertyId, address caller) {
        require(verifyOwnership(propertyId, caller), "Caller is not the property owner");
        _;
    }

    // Verify ownership - to be implemented by inheriting contracts
    function verifyOwnership(uint256 propertyId, address caller) public view virtual override returns (bool);

    // Execute authority change in metadata contract
    function proposeAuthorityChange(uint256 propertyId, address newAuthority) public override onlyPropertyOwner(propertyId, msg.sender) {
        address metadataContract = propertyMetadataContracts[propertyId];
        require(metadataContract != address(0), "Metadata contract not set");

        // Call the metadata contract to propose the authority change
        PropertyMetadata(metadataContract).proposeOwnershipAuthorityChange(propertyId, newAuthority);
    }
}
```

---

### **3. Implement ERC-721 as an Ownership Authority**
The ERC-721 contract inherits from `OwnershipBase` and implements the `verifyOwnership` function to check token ownership.

#### **ERC-721 Ownership Contract**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "./OwnershipBase.sol";
import "./PropertyMetadata.sol";

contract PropertyOwnership is ERC721, OwnershipBase {
    constructor() ERC721("PropertyNFT", "PROP") {}

    // Mint a new token and link it to a metadata contract
    function mint(uint256 tokenId, address metadataContract, address to) public {
        _mint(to, tokenId);
        propertyMetadataContracts[tokenId] = metadataContract;
    }

    // Verify ownership of the token
    function verifyOwnership(uint256 propertyId, address caller) public view override returns (bool) {
        return ownerOf(propertyId) == caller;
    }
}
```

---

### **4. Metadata Contract**
The metadata contract interacts with any ownership authority via the standardized `IOwnershipAuthority` interface.

#### **Metadata Contract**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract PropertyMetadata {
    struct Metadata {
        string location;
        string description;
        uint256 appraisedValue;
        address ownershipAuthority; // Current ownership authority
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Metadata) public properties;

    event OwnershipAuthorityUpdated(uint256 propertyId, address newAuthority);

    // Modifier to ensure only the current authority can call
    modifier onlyCurrentAuthority(uint256 propertyId) {
        require(
            msg.sender == properties[propertyId].ownershipAuthority,
            "Caller is not the current ownership authority"
        );
        _;
    }

    // Create property metadata
    function createProperty(
        uint256 propertyId,
        string memory location,
        string memory description,
        uint256 appraisedValue,
        address initialAuthority
    ) public {
        properties[propertyId] = Metadata(location, description, appraisedValue, initialAuthority);
    }

    // Update ownership authority
    function proposeOwnershipAuthorityChange(uint256 propertyId, address newAuthority) public onlyCurrentAuthority(propertyId) {
        properties[propertyId].ownershipAuthority = newAuthority;
        emit OwnershipAuthorityUpdated(propertyId, newAuthority);
    }
}
```

---

### **How This Works**

#### **Standardized Logic**
1. **Base Contract**:
   - Provides shared logic (`verifyOwnership`, `proposeAuthorityChange`) for any contract acting as an ownership authority.
   - Inheriting contracts (e.g., ERC-721) only need to implement their specific ownership verification logic.

2. **Metadata Contract**:
   - Always interacts with the ownership authority using the `IOwnershipAuthority` interface, ensuring compatibility with any future ownership standard.

#### **Ownership Change Process**
1. **The NFT Owner**:
   - Calls the `proposeAuthorityChange` function on the ERC-721 contract.
2. **ERC-721 Contract**:
   - Verifies that the caller owns the token.
   - Calls the `proposeOwnershipAuthorityChange` function on the metadata contract.
3. **Metadata Contract**:
   - Updates the `ownershipAuthority` for the property.

---

### **Future Compatibility**
1. **Future Ownership Standards**:
   - Any new ownership standard (e.g., ERC-XYZ) can implement `IOwnershipAuthority` and inherit from `OwnershipBase`.
   - This ensures that the new standard works seamlessly with the existing metadata contract.

2. **Migration**:
   - When migrating to a new standard, the same process applies: the current authority verifies ownership and updates the metadata.
