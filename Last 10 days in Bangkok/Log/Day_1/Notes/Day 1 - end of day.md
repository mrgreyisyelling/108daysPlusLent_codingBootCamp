Here’s how we can refine tomorrow’s plan, balancing Project 3 (Voting System) and Project 4 (Gas Tracker) while staying flexible:

---

### **Tomorrow’s Detailed Plan**

#### **Morning: Recap and Setup**
1. **Debrief on Today’s Accomplishments:**
   - Review the Wallet contract and deployment/testing scripts.
   - Note key lessons learned and improvements to carry forward.

2. **Prep for Projects:**
   - Review mappings, arrays, and events (Project 3).
   - Discuss gas mechanics, function optimization, and estimation (Project 4).

---

#### **Project 3: Voting System**
- **Focus:** Reinforcing mappings, events, and modifiers.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Mapping & Logic Setup:**
     - Define mappings for proposals and voting records.
     - Write the logic for `vote(uint proposalId)` and ensure it:
       - Emits events.
       - Prevents double voting.
  2. **Proposal Management:**
     - Add `onlyOwner` functionality to manage proposals.
     - Ensure dynamic proposal creation is possible.
  3. **Test Cases:**
     - Write scripts to test voting under various conditions.
     - Include edge cases like double-voting and invalid proposals.

#### **Project 4: Gas Tracker**
- **Focus:** Understanding gas consumption patterns in Solidity.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Create Gas-Intensive Functions:**
     - Write a looping function to perform computationally heavy operations.
     - Write a lightweight function for comparison.
  2. **Deploy and Measure:**
     - Deploy the contract and execute functions.
     - Compare gas costs for heavy and light operations using test scripts.
  3. **Analysis and Optimization:**
     - Discuss why specific operations are gas-heavy.
     - Explore methods to optimize gas consumption.

---

#### **Afternoon: Execute and Iterate**
1. **Build and Debug Projects:**
   - Focus on completing Project 3 (Voting System).
   - Transition to Project 4 (Gas Tracker) if time allows.

2. **Deepen Testing Practices:**
   - Refine deployment and interaction scripts for automation.
   - Test contracts on various inputs and edge cases.

3. **Code Reviews and Reflection:**
   - Review each project for potential improvements.
   - Discuss how these skills apply to larger development goals.

---

#### **Evening: Bootcamp Insights and Realignment**
1. **Analyze Chainlink Bootcamp Learnings:**
   - Review the bootcamp transcript and connect it to your progress.
   - Plan how to incorporate Chainlink-related concepts into upcoming projects.

2. **Refine the 10-Day Plan:**
   - Adjust focus areas based on the day’s progress and insights from the bootcamp.
