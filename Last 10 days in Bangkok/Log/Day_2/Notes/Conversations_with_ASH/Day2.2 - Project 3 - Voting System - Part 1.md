### **Project 3: Voting System**

#### **Objective**
Create a voting system where:
1. Users can vote on proposals.
2. Each user can vote only once per proposal.
3. Only the owner can create proposals.

---

#### **Requirements**

1. **Tracking Proposals**:
   - Use a `mapping(uint => uint)` to keep track of the number of votes each proposal receives.
   - Each proposal is identified by a `proposalId` (an unsigned integer).

2. **Tracking Voter Participation**:
   - Use a `mapping(address => mapping(uint => bool))` to track whether a user has voted for a specific proposal.

3. **Ownership**:
   - Only the contract owner can create new proposals.
   - Add an `onlyOwner` modifier to enforce this.

4. **Core Functions**:
   - **Create Proposal**:
     - Accepts a `string memory description` as input.
     - Generates a unique `proposalId` and stores the description.
   - **Vote**:
     - Accepts a `proposalId` as input.
     - Checks if the user has already voted.
     - Updates the vote count for the proposal.
   - **Get Votes**:
     - Accepts a `proposalId` as input.
     - Returns the total number of votes for that proposal.

5. **Events**:
   - **ProposalCreated**:
     - Logs the `proposalId` and `description`.
   - **VoteCast**:
     - Logs the `proposalId` and `voter address`.

---

#### **Abstract Pseudo Code**

1. **State Variables**:
   - A `mapping` to track votes for proposals.
   - A `mapping` to track if a user has voted.
   - A `struct` (optional) to store the proposal description.

2. **Modifiers**:
   - `onlyOwner`: Ensures only the owner can create proposals.

3. **Functions**:
   - `createProposal(description)`:
     - Increment a `proposalCounter` for unique IDs.
     - Map the `description` to the proposal.
     - Emit `ProposalCreated`.

   - `vote(proposalId)`:
     - Check if the `proposalId` exists.
     - Verify if the user has already voted.
     - Increment the vote count for the proposal.
     - Mark the user as having voted.
     - Emit `VoteCast`.

   - `getVotes(proposalId)`:
     - Return the vote count for the `proposalId`.

You're making solid progress! However, there are some issues in the code. Let's go through step-by-step corrections and explanations to refine it.

---

### **Corrections & Explanations**

#### **1. Contract Declaration**
- `contract VotingSystem(){` should be `contract VotingSystem {`.
- The parentheses after the contract name are unnecessary.

#### **2. State Variables**
- Variable declarations like `address owner public;` should be written as `public address owner;`.
- `ProposalVotes`, `VoterVotes`, and `ProposalDescription` should use `mapping(uint256 => uint256)`, `mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool))`, and `mapping(uint256 => string)` respectively.
- `proposalCount` should not have the `public` keyword unless you want an automatic getter function.

#### **3. Use of `null`**
- Solidity doesn’t have a `null` keyword. For checking whether a string exists, compare it to an empty string `""`.

#### **4. Boolean Comparison**
- Use `!VoterVotes[msg.sender][ProposalID]` instead of `VoterVotes[msg.sender][ProposalID] == False` for clarity and convention.

#### **5. Return Type for `getVotes`**
- The `getVotes` function should have the `view` keyword since it doesn’t modify state.

#### **6. Missing Constructor**
- You need a constructor to initialize the owner of the contract.

#### **7. Syntax Issues**
- Missing semicolons in multiple places (e.g., after `return ProposalVotes[ProposalID]`).
- Event names and variable names should follow consistent naming conventions (`camelCase` or `PascalCase`).

---

### **Refined Code**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

contract VotingSystem {
    // State Variables
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public proposalVotes; // Track votes for each proposal
    mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public voterVotes; // Track voter participation
    mapping(uint256 => string) public proposalDescriptions; // Track proposal descriptions
    address public owner; // Contract owner
    uint256 public proposalCount; // Count of proposals

    // Events
    event ProposalCreated(uint256 proposalID, string description);
    event VoteCast(address voter, uint256 proposalID);

    // Constructor
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Modifiers
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
        _;
    }

    // Functions
    function createProposal(string memory description) public onlyOwner {
        proposalCount += 1;
        proposalVotes[proposalCount] = 0; // Initialize votes to 0
        proposalDescriptions[proposalCount] = description; // Add description
        emit ProposalCreated(proposalCount, description); // Emit event
    }

    function castVote(uint256 proposalID) public {
        require(proposalID <= proposalCount, "Proposal doesn't exist");
        require(bytes(proposalDescriptions[proposalID]).length > 0, "Proposal doesn't exist");
        require(!voterVotes[msg.sender][proposalID], "Already voted");
        voterVotes[msg.sender][proposalID] = true; // Mark voter as having voted
        proposalVotes[proposalID] += 1; // Increment vote count
        emit VoteCast(msg.sender, proposalID); // Emit event
    }

    function getVotes(uint256 proposalID) public view returns (uint256) {
        return proposalVotes[proposalID]; // Return total votes for proposal
    }
}
```

---

### **Key Fixes**
1. **Constructor**: Ensures the owner is set at deployment.
2. **String Comparison**: Uses `bytes(description).length > 0` to check for existence.
3. **Modifiers**: `onlyOwner` ensures only the owner can create proposals.
4. **Semantics**: Aligns with Solidity's syntax and conventions.

Start implementing and testing this refined logic! Let me know if you encounter any issues.

To write a testing script that retrieves specific variable values, you can leverage the getter functions automatically generated by Solidity for `public` variables or create custom functions to retrieve private variables. Below is a step-by-step guide for your specific `VotingSystem` contract:

---

### **Steps to Access Variables in the Script**
1. **Deploy the Contract:**
   - Use `hre.ethers.getContractFactory` to deploy your `VotingSystem` contract.

2. **Access `public` Variables:**
   - Solidity automatically creates getter functions for variables marked `public`. For example:
     ```javascript
     const owner = await votingSystem.owner(); // Returns the owner address
     const proposalCount = await votingSystem.proposalCount(); // Returns proposal count
     const votes = await votingSystem.proposalVotes(1); // Returns votes for proposal ID 1
     ```

3. **Call `view` Functions:**
   - Call functions like `getVotes` to retrieve computed or private values:
     ```javascript
     const votesForProposal = await votingSystem.getVotes(1); // Example for proposal ID 1
     ```

4. **Log Results:**
   - Use `console.log` to print results and verify correctness.

---

### **Example Testing Script**

```javascript
// scripts/test_voting_system.js

const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const [owner, voter1, voter2] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  console.log("Deploying contract with owner:", owner.address);

  // Deploy the VotingSystem contract
  const VotingSystem = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("VotingSystem");
  const votingSystem = await VotingSystem.deploy();
  await votingSystem.deployed();

  console.log("VotingSystem deployed at:", votingSystem.address);

  // Create a proposal
  console.log("Creating a new proposal...");
  let tx = await votingSystem.createProposal("Proposal 1: Increase funding for education");
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Proposal created successfully!");

  // Retrieve and log proposal details
  const proposalCount = await votingSystem.proposalCount();
  const proposalDescription = await votingSystem.proposalDescriptions(proposalCount);

  console.log(`Current Proposal Count: ${proposalCount}`);
  console.log(`Proposal ID ${proposalCount} Description: ${proposalDescription}`);

  // Cast a vote from voter1
  console.log("Voter 1 casting vote on Proposal 1...");
  tx = await votingSystem.connect(voter1).castVote(1);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Vote cast successfully!");

  // Check vote count
  const votesForProposal1 = await votingSystem.getVotes(1);
  console.log(`Votes for Proposal 1: ${votesForProposal1}`);

  // Attempt to vote again (should fail)
  console.log("Voter 1 attempting to vote again on Proposal 1...");
  try {
    tx = await votingSystem.connect(voter1).castVote(1);
    await tx.wait();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during double voting attempt:", error.message);
  }

  // Cast a vote from voter2
  console.log("Voter 2 casting vote on Proposal 1...");
  tx = await votingSystem.connect(voter2).castVote(1);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Vote cast successfully!");

  // Final vote count
  const finalVotesForProposal1 = await votingSystem.getVotes(1);
  console.log(`Final votes for Proposal 1: ${finalVotesForProposal1}`);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

---

### **Explanation of Script**

1. **Deploy Contract**:
   - `hre.ethers.getContractFactory` creates a contract factory for `VotingSystem`.
   - `votingSystem.deploy()` deploys the contract.

2. **Create Proposal**:
   - `votingSystem.createProposal("Proposal 1: Increase funding for education")` is used by the owner.

3. **Retrieve Proposal Details**:
   - `votingSystem.proposalDescriptions(proposalID)` retrieves the description.
   - `votingSystem.proposalCount()` retrieves the total count.

4. **Cast Votes**:
   - `votingSystem.connect(voter1).castVote(1)` allows `voter1` to vote.

5. **Double Voting Check**:
   - The `require` in `castVote` prevents multiple votes for the same proposal.

6. **Print Results**:
   - `console.log` outputs retrieved values for debugging and validation.

---

### **Run the Script**
- Save the script in `scripts/test_voting_system.js`.
- Run it using Hardhat:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/test_voting_system.js --network localhost
  ```

Let me know if you face any issues while implementing!

Here are the issues and suggestions for your script:

---

### **Corrections and Suggestions**

1. **Deployment Log Error**:
   - You are logging `VotingSystem.address`, which refers to the contract factory, not the deployed instance.
   - Fix:
     ```javascript
     console.log("VotingSystem contract deployed to:", votingSystem.address);
     ```

2. **Unhandled Access Control for Proposal Creation**:
   - If a non-owner (`user_1`) tries to create a proposal, it should fail due to the `onlyOwner` modifier. Your current script will throw an error and stop execution.
   - Fix:
     Use a `try-catch` block to handle and log the error:
     ```javascript
     try {
       tx = await votingSystem.connect(user_1).createProposal(proposalDescription);
       await tx.wait();
       console.log("Proposal created by user_1 (unexpected)");
     } catch (error) {
       console.error("Failed to create proposal by user_1:", error.message);
     }
     ```

3. **Double Voting Error**:
   - If the same user (`owner`) casts a vote twice, it should fail due to the `require` in `castVote`. Again, a `try-catch` block is needed.
   - Fix:
     ```javascript
     try {
       tx = await votingSystem.connect(owner).castVote(proposalID);
       await tx.wait();
       console.log("Vote cast by owner twice (unexpected)");
     } catch (error) {
       console.error("Failed to cast vote by owner twice:", error.message);
     }
     ```

4. **`proposalID` Initialization**:
   - Ensure `proposalID` matches the `proposalCount` of the created proposal (likely `1` after creation).

5. **Logging Vote Count**:
   - Use `hre.ethers.utils.formatUnits` for better readability if the vote count is a `BigNumber`.
     ```javascript
     console.log("Vote Count:", voteCount.toString());
     ```

---

### **Corrected Script**

```javascript
// scripts/test_votingSystem.js

const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const [owner, user_1, user_2] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  console.log("Using Account:", owner.address);

  // Deploy VotingSystem
  const VotingSystem = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("VotingSystem");
  const votingSystem = await VotingSystem.deploy();
  await votingSystem.deployed();

  console.log("VotingSystem contract deployed to:", votingSystem.address);

  // Initial state
  console.log("Owner address:", await votingSystem.owner());
  console.log("Proposal Count:", await votingSystem.proposalCount());

  // Create a proposal
  const proposalDescription = "Description 1";

  console.log("Creating proposal as owner...");
  let tx = await votingSystem.connect(owner).createProposal(proposalDescription);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Proposal created by owner.");

  console.log("Attempting to create proposal as user_1...");
  try {
    tx = await votingSystem.connect(user_1).createProposal(proposalDescription);
    await tx.wait();
    console.log("Proposal created by user_1 (unexpected)");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to create proposal by user_1:", error.message);
  }

  // Cast a vote
  const proposalID = 1;

  console.log("Casting vote by owner...");
  tx = await votingSystem.connect(owner).castVote(proposalID);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Vote cast by owner.");

  console.log("Attempting to cast vote again by owner...");
  try {
    tx = await votingSystem.connect(owner).castVote(proposalID);
    await tx.wait();
    console.log("Vote cast by owner twice (unexpected)");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to cast vote by owner twice:", error.message);
  }

  console.log("Casting vote by user_1...");
  tx = await votingSystem.connect(user_1).castVote(proposalID);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Vote cast by user_1.");

  console.log("Casting vote by user_2...");
  tx = await votingSystem.connect(user_2).castVote(proposalID);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Vote cast by user_2.");

  // Get votes on proposal
  const voteCount = await votingSystem.getVotes(proposalID);
  console.log("Vote Count for Proposal ID", proposalID, ":", voteCount.toString());
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

---

### **Testing Outcomes**

1. Owner creates a proposal successfully.
2. Non-owner (`user_1`) fails to create a proposal with an appropriate error message.
3. Owner votes successfully but fails when attempting to vote again.
4. Both `user_1` and `user_2` cast valid votes.
5. Total vote count is logged correctly.

Here's a comprehensive list of CLI commands to set up a new Hardhat project from scratch, including installing dependencies:

```bash
# Step 1: Create a new project folder and navigate into it
mkdir VotingSystemProject
cd VotingSystemProject

# Step 2: Initialize an NPM project
npm init -y

# Step 3: Install Hardhat
npm install --save-dev hardhat

# Step 4: Create a new Hardhat project
npx hardhat

# Select "Create a basic sample project" and follow the prompts

# Step 5: Install Hardhat dependencies
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers

# Step 6: (Optional) Install additional dependencies for testing and linting
npm install --save-dev chai mocha @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers

# Step 7: Clean the pre-generated files (if desired)
rm -rf contracts/*
rm -rf scripts/*
rm -rf test/*

# Step 8: Create folders for custom contracts and scripts
mkdir -p contracts scripts test

# Step 9: Verify your setup
npx hardhat compile

# Step 10: Start a local Hardhat node
npx hardhat node
```

---

### After Setup:
1. **Contracts**: Write your `VotingSystem.sol` contract in the `contracts/` folder.
2. **Scripts**: Add your deployment or test scripts to the `scripts/` folder.
3. **Testing**: Add test files to the `test/` folder.

You can now start developing and testing your VotingSystem contract. Let me know if you run into any issues!

----
----

Here's the list of setup commands rewritten for **Yarn**:

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize a new Yarn project
yarn init -y

# Step 2: Install Hardhat
yarn add --dev hardhat --verbose

# Step 3: Create a Hardhat project
npx hardhat # Follow the prompts to create a new project

# Step 4: Install Ethers.js and Hardhat plugins
yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers@^5.7.0 --verbose

# Step 5: Install dotenv for environment variable management (optional)
yarn add dotenv --verbose

# Step 6: Install additional dependencies for testing and linting (optional)
yarn add --dev chai mocha @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers --verbose

# Step 7: Run Hardhat in development mode
yarn hardhat node
```

This version uses Yarn throughout for dependency management and ensures verbose output for debugging any potential installation issues.

The error occurs because `string` in Solidity doesn't have a `length` property. To check the length of a `string`, you must first convert it to `bytes`. This is why `bytes` is used—to access the `length` property of the string in its byte representation.

Here's the corrected line of code:

```solidity
require(bytes(proposalDescription[proposalID]).length > 0, "Proposal Doesn't Exist");
```

### Explanation:

- `proposalDescription[proposalID]` retrieves the `string` value.
- Wrapping it with `bytes(...)` converts the `string` into its byte representation.
- `.length` then accesses the length of the resulting `bytes`.

### Why use `bytes`?
Solidity's `string` type doesn't directly support length queries or index access for security and gas reasons. Converting it to `bytes` enables such operations efficiently.

Let me know if you need further clarification or have other questions!

Absolutely, before moving on from **Project 3 (Voting System)**, here are some abstract and conceptual points worth reflecting on. These will deepen your understanding of what you've built and prepare you for more advanced projects:

---

### **1. Ownership and Access Control**
   - **Abstract Question**: Why is it critical that only the owner can create proposals? What happens if this control is removed or misused?
   - **Key Takeaway**: Access control ensures trust in governance. However, DAO systems often include mechanisms for transferring ownership or decentralizing it over time.

---

### **2. Double-Vote Prevention**
   - **Abstract Question**: What mechanisms ensure that a voter can vote only once per proposal? 
   - **Key Takeaway**: You used a `mapping(address => mapping(uint => bool))` to track whether a voter voted on a specific proposal. This is efficient but requires careful handling in larger systems to avoid bloating state storage.

---

### **3. Proposal Management**
   - **Abstract Question**: How do you handle inactive or invalid proposals? Should proposals be removed, archived, or updated after they are no longer relevant?
   - **Key Takeaway**: Currently, your contract tracks active proposals implicitly. Consider adding features to explicitly manage proposal lifecycle states (e.g., `open`, `closed`, `expired`).

---

### **4. Gas Costs and Scalability**
   - **Abstract Question**: How does the number of proposals and voters affect gas costs? What are the potential risks for large-scale usage?
   - **Key Takeaway**: Public mappings and state changes (like adding votes) can become costly as the system scales. Larger DAOs often offload some processing to off-chain computation and use Merkle proofs or ZK-proofs to verify results on-chain.

---

### **5. Events and Observability**
   - **Abstract Question**: What purpose do `ProposalCreated` and `VoteCast` events serve? How are these events utilized in a real-world application?
   - **Key Takeaway**: Events are critical for off-chain systems to monitor contract activity without reading storage directly, saving costs and enabling better integration with frontends.

---

### **6. Decentralization in Governance**
   - **Abstract Question**: Right now, the contract requires an owner. What changes would be necessary to make the system ownerless or community-driven, like a true DAO?
   - **Key Takeaway**: In DAOs, proposal creation is often tied to token ownership or staking rather than a central owner. Consider adding mechanisms where a group of users can collectively propose and vote on governance actions.

---

### **7. Voting Transparency**
   - **Abstract Question**: Should the system reveal the identity of voters and their votes? Or should it be designed to keep votes anonymous?
   - **Key Takeaway**: Transparency is often required for public trust, but anonymity can be critical for certain use cases. Future upgrades might include encrypted or delayed vote reveal mechanisms.

---

### **8. Upgradability**
   - **Abstract Question**: What if you need to add new features or fix bugs? Is this system upgradeable?
   - **Key Takeaway**: Contracts like yours are immutable once deployed. To handle upgrades, you might explore proxy patterns (e.g., OpenZeppelin's `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`) in future projects.

---

### **Next Steps in Understanding DAOs**
If you're inspired to evolve this voting system into a DAO governance model, here are some topics worth exploring:
   - **Token-Based Governance**: Weighted voting based on token holdings.
   - **Treasury Management**: Managing funds based on proposals.
   - **Quorums**: Requiring a minimum number of votes to validate a proposal.
   - **Timelocks**: Adding delays to proposal execution to give time for dispute resolution.

Take a moment to absorb these concepts. If you're ready, we can dive into **Project 4 (Gas Tracker)** or build extensions for this voting system. Let me know your preference!
