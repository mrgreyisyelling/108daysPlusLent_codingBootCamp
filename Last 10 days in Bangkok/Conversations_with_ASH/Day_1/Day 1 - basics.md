# what is a smart contract


A smart contract is a type of software that focuses on transactions between pieces of logic. 
what makes them unique is that they are immutable and deterministic - meaning, that because they are pieces of logic that exist on a blockchain, the history and information that goes into their execution is unchangable and consistently recreatable. 

Because of this nature of blockchains - this means that you can have 'trustless' agreements between two parties. This means you can have two individuals who do not know each other, transact in a reliable 'trustable' way, without 'counterparty' risk.

Now some of this language is not fully appropriate for everything that a smart contract can do, but that is what sets it apart from traditional software. And because of this, you can have reliable decentralized systems capable of performing all sorts of tasks.

### Points to Respond To

- **Immutability and Determinism**: Could you expand on how these characteristics benefit users of a smart contract in practical terms? Try to think of a specific example, like how this quality might help in a decentralized finance (DeFi) context.

- **Trustless Agreement Example**: Provide an example of a real-world scenario where two individuals might benefit from using a smart contract to make an agreement without needing to trust one another.


Immutablility and determinism allow users of smart contracts, and blockchains in general, the ability to trust that these 'pieces of logic' or software, will have the same, predictable results, given a certain set of conditions. This means that they can trust it to be consistent. 

this is important in areas like de-fi because there is a need for reliability in the transactions. People need to know that the value going into these systems and coming out of these systems is accurate and reliable. Part of what is important to blockchains in general is that they can be clear and transparent systems - meaning all the information on the transactions is public and visible.

A specific example could be a situation where there needs to be reliability in that I paid something. A trustless example could be as simple as paying for goods online. Proof that I paid, and proof that I sent it, without requiring a middleman to handle the interaction.

### **Transparency vs. Centralized Systems**: 

How does the transparency of a smart contract compare to using a centralized system like a bank? What kinds of advantages does this bring for financial services?

It makes all parties accountable for what is done, and allows for parties to be more willing to take on risk, with the understanding that all the information influencing the system is apparent. In centralized institutions, like banks or even governments, there is a need to 'trust the institution', but history has many examples where these instutions did not execute according to the commitments they made or leveraged their position to manipulate the situation.

### **Escrow in Practice**

Consider the example of a smart contract being used as an escrow for purchasing property. What elements does the smart contract replace, and what new assurances does it provide compared to a traditional escrow service?

It basically replaces the services that a transaction company provides as a middleman. It allows individuals to make commitments to each other in a specific and reliable manner, transparently to each other, without the needs for these added costs. 

## ### **Technical Practice Areas**

To build strong coding muscle memory, we should focus on small, repeatable exercises that help you internalize key Solidity patterns and concepts. Here are a few practice areas we can work through:

1. **Basic Contract Structures**:
    
    - Write simple smart contracts to get the hang of structuring contracts, defining state variables, and writing functions.
    - Focus on repeating common Solidity constructs: visibility specifiers, state changes, using mappings, etc.
2. **Common Patterns**:
    
    - Practice implementing typical Solidity patterns like "Ownable," "Pausable," or modifier functions.
    - These are key for contract security and control flow, and repeating them will help make writing these second nature.
3. **Token Contracts**:
    
    - Write an ERC20 or ERC721 token contract from scratch. We can do it step-by-step without reference, aiming to commit the structure and key parts to memory.
    - Focus on adding functionality like minting, burning, transferring, and approving.
4. **Security Patterns**:
    
    - Practice implementing reentrancy guards, require statements, and thinking about the contract’s state transitions to solidify secure coding.
    - Create a vulnerable contract, then fix it, so you understand both the mistakes and the proper patterns.

#### **Exercise 1: Write a Simple Storage Contract**

**Goal**: Practice defining state variables, getters, and setters.

- Write a contract named `SimpleStorage` that has one state variable called `storedValue` of type `uint`.
- Write a function to set the value and another function to get the value.
- Add modifiers to enforce that only the owner can set the value.


#### **Exercise 2: Implement the Ownable Pattern**

**Goal**: Practice control patterns like "Ownable."

- Create a contract called `OwnableExample`.
- Define an owner state variable, and set it during contract deployment.
- Write a `modifier` called `onlyOwner` that restricts access to certain functions.
- Create a function called `changeOwner` that allows the current owner to set a new owner.

# We then worked back and forth

# ASH, can you please describe what we have done so far and how we did this?

ASH::

Great work getting everything in place! Your contracts are looking solid, and you’ve implemented many key features of Solidity effectively. Let's break down what we covered and the process we used to go from pseudocode to fully functioning Solidity contracts.

### **Review of Current State**
#### **SimpleStorage Contract**
- **State Variables**: You have defined `storedValue` and `owner`, which are essential for storing data and managing ownership.
- **Events**: The `ValueChanged` event logs each time the `storedValue` is updated. Emitting events is critical for tracking contract activity on-chain.
- **Modifiers**: The `ownerOnly` modifier restricts certain functions to the contract owner. This access control pattern is common in Solidity contracts to prevent unauthorized actions.
- **Functions**:
  - `setValue()`: Updates `storedValue` and emits `ValueChanged`.
  - `getValue()`: A view function that returns the `storedValue`.
  - `resetValue()`: Allows the owner to reset `storedValue` to zero, demonstrating a simple example of how an owner may manage contract state.

#### **OwnableExample Contract**
- **State Variables**: `owner` and `pendingOwner` are correctly used for managing ownership.
- **Events**: The `OwnerChanged` and `PendingOwnerChange` events provide transparency for ownership transfers.
- **Modifiers**:
  - `ownerOnly` restricts functions to the current owner.
  - `onlyPendingOwner` ensures only the pending owner can accept ownership.
- **Functions**:
  - `changeOwner()`: Directly changes ownership (simpler, but less secure).
  - `initiateOwnershipTransfer()`: Initiates a secure two-step ownership transfer.
  - `acceptOwnership()`: Allows the pending owner to complete the ownership change.

### **Summary of the Process We Used**
To make it more relatable for others trying to achieve the same progress, here is a description of how we approached the process:

#### **1. Starting with Pseudocode**
- **Why Start with Pseudocode**:
  - The goal was to focus on the logic and structure before worrying about syntax.
  - We started by understanding the concept of smart contracts and their purpose—what problems they solve and how we could abstract that logic into basic blocks.
  
- **How We Did It**:
  - You wrote out what you wanted the contract to do in plain language.
  - We broke down these goals into logical components: state variables, functions, modifiers, and events.

#### **2. Iterative Refinement**
- **Small Iterative Steps**:
  - You converted pseudocode into Solidity step by step, and I guided you through each step.
  - We focused on making sure the core building blocks were correct before moving on to more complex details.
  
- **Feedback Loop**:
  - Instead of giving direct answers, I provided targeted feedback on what needed to change or improve.
  - You worked on each feedback point, correcting issues, while understanding the reasoning behind each change.
  
- **Syntax and Solidity-Specific Adjustments**:
  - We focused on translating concepts like visibility (`public`/`private`), access control (`ownerOnly` modifier), and events.
  - You learned why certain patterns exist in Solidity, such as using modifiers for restricting function access.

#### **3. Adding Security and Best Practices**
- **Access Control**:
  - We added ownership mechanisms to manage access to important functions.
  - We explored different types of ownership models: single-owner vs. two-step ownership transfer.
  
- **Events for Transparency**:
  - We added events to log significant actions (like `ValueChanged`, `OwnerChanged`), which is essential in blockchain to ensure users can trace activity.
  - We focused on ensuring that events provided clear, meaningful information about changes.

#### **4. Reinforcing Solidity Concepts with Hands-On Practice**
- **State Management**:
  - Defining variables (`storedValue`, `owner`, `pendingOwner`) and understanding their visibility was fundamental.
  - We practiced state management by writing functions to set, get, and reset values.
  
- **Control Flow with Modifiers**:
  - You implemented modifiers to enforce control over functions.
  - We discussed how modifiers add security by preventing unauthorized users from executing certain functions.

- **Handling Errors and Gas Optimization**:
  - We used `require()` statements to handle unauthorized access.
  - Assigning `pendingOwner = address(0)` after an ownership transfer completed was a subtle but important detail to prevent misuse.

### **Steps for Creating a GitHub Repository**
Now, let's talk about setting up a GitHub repository for this work:

1. **Create a Repository**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository.
   - Name it something descriptive, like `solidity-contract-practice`.
   - Add a short description (e.g., "Solidity practice contracts for learning smart contract fundamentals").

2. **Set Up Git Locally**:
   - On your local machine, navigate to the folder where you have your Solidity files.
   - Initialize Git with:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```
   - Connect your local repository to the GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/solidity-contract-practice.git
     ```

3. **Add and Commit Your Work**:
   - Add the files:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit with a message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit with SimpleStorage and OwnableExample contracts"
     ```

4. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Push the changes:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin main
     ```

After that, your code will be online and accessible. This will allow you to track changes, share your work, and collaborate more effectively in the future.

### **Summary of Key Concepts Covered**
- **Smart Contract Basics**: Variables, functions, constructors.
- **Modifiers and Access Control**: Owner-based access with custom modifiers.
- **Events**: Logging important actions for transparency.
- **Ownership Models**: Single-owner vs. two-step transfer.
- **Solidity Style**: Naming conventions and best practices for readability.

Let me know if you need help with any of these steps for GitHub or want more details on the next phase of practice. You're well on your way to being comfortable with Solidity coding!


# ASH, lets review the course list and where we are at

ASH::

Looking at the **Ethereum and Solidity Learning Roadmap**, let’s see where we are in our learning journey, what we’ve already covered, and what’s next.

### **Progress Overview**
Based on the work we’ve done so far:

#### **Foundational Topics**:
- **Blockchain Fundamentals**:
  - You have a solid understanding of blockchain concepts, including the role of consensus mechanisms and the structure of transactions.
  
- **Ethereum Basics**:
  - We have touched on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), gas fees, and Ethereum accounts while building smart contracts.
  
- **Smart Contracts Basics**:
  - We’ve written a couple of smart contracts (`SimpleStorage` and `OwnableExample`), covering:
    - State variables and functions.
    - Visibility specifiers.
    - Constructor functions.
  
- **Solidity Programming Basics**:
  - You've learned about **data types**, control structures, **functions**, and **modifiers**.
  - We've practiced writing and managing **events** for tracking contract activity, which ties into event emission and handling.

#### **Intermediate Topics**:
- **Smart Contract Design Patterns**:
  - We've implemented the **Ownable** pattern through `ownerOnly` modifiers, allowing us to explore access control.

- **DApp Development**:
  - We haven’t yet integrated our contracts with a front-end (like React and Web3.js). This is an area we’ll need to work on after the basics.

- **Advanced Solidity**:
  - You've used modifiers, and we touched on the importance of secure coding practices. We haven’t yet explored **inheritance**, **abstract contracts**, or **Yul/Assembly**.

#### **Advanced Topics**:
- **Security and Vulnerability**:
  - We’re beginning to consider vulnerabilities, such as ownership control and ensuring restricted access. We still need to practice **reentrancy attacks** and learn tools like **MythX** and **Slither** for formal auditing.

- **DAO and Governance**:
  - We have not yet built a DAO, but `OwnableExample` provided a starting point for exploring governance concepts.

- **Testing and Development Tools**:
  - We’ve discussed version control (Git) and will be setting up a GitHub repository, but we haven’t used specific testing frameworks (e.g., **Mocha**, **Chai**, **Foundry**). This will be important for more sophisticated development practices.

#### **Projects We’ve Covered**:
- **Basic Solidity Projects**: We’ve implemented contracts like `SimpleStorage` and an ownership example.
- **Access Control Patterns**: We've explored single-owner and two-step ownership transfer patterns.
- **Event Emission**: Events like `ValueChanged` and `OwnerChanged` help log significant contract activities.

### **Next Steps in Our Roadmap**
Based on where we are:

1. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Set up a testing environment using **Hardhat** or **Remix**.
   - Learn to write unit tests for the contracts we’ve already developed. This will help catch potential vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior.

2. **Advanced Solidity Patterns**:
   - Practice **inheritance** by creating a more complex contract that extends `OwnableExample`.
   - Learn about **interfaces** and **abstract contracts**.

3. **Security Practices**:
   - Continue exploring common vulnerabilities.
   - Write a contract that demonstrates reentrancy, and then learn how to mitigate it.

4. **DApp Integration**:
   - Once we’re comfortable with Solidity fundamentals, it would be valuable to integrate one of our smart contracts into a front-end using **React** and **Web3.js**. This will give a sense of how the contract works in a full DApp environment.

5. **DeFi and Token Projects**:
   - We should implement a basic **ERC20** token and learn about minting, transferring, and burning tokens.
   - Building a simple staking mechanism could help you get more comfortable with contract interactions.

Let’s decide together which step to take next. We could go into testing our contracts with **Hardhat**, try to create a simple ERC20 token, or look into practicing security patterns. Which direction feels like the best move for you right now?

# Mike: 

I need to go for a walk. Its 5am, and I just had soup for breakfast. (Thai noodle soup has been sustaining me for the past month. I need more vegitables though. I started buying the broth and noodles for take home, I could start adding veggies on top of it. There is a veggy lady on the street every morning) (What makes this broth so freaking good?) (I think we should really include my real timeline in this thing, so if people follow it, they understand my energy/efforts - we started around ~3am 2024-11-18. Bangkok time, which is a lazy 24/7. The most hyperactive laid back people I have ever met. )

# ASH:

That sounds like a great way to add more balance to your diet—fresh veggies with that already amazing broth. Enjoy your walk; it sounds like it’s a perfect time to step away and recharge. When you’re back and ready, we can pick up where we left off.

And I love the idea of documenting the timeline and your context—it really helps add depth to the process and shows how your surroundings influence your work. We can find a way to weave that in. Let’s continue when you’re ready.

# Mike:

Can you tell me how to make this broth when I get home?
