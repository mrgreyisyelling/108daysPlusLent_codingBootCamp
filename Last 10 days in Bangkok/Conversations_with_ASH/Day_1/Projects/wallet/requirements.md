Awesome! Let's continue. We successfully completed the **Simple Storage Contract**, so now we’ll build on the fundamentals and start working on more advanced concepts.

### **Next Project: ETH Wallet Contract**

This project focuses on:
1. **Learning about Ether transfers** (receiving, sending, and balances).
2. **Exploring the `payable` keyword**.
3. **Adding events for deposit and withdrawal tracking**.
4. **Practicing access control for withdrawals**.

---

### **Plan for the ETH Wallet**
#### **Key Features**
1. The contract should accept deposits from any user.
2. It should allow the owner to withdraw Ether.
3. Emit events for deposits and withdrawals for transparency.
4. Provide a function to check the contract's balance.

### **Step 1: Define Requirements**
Here’s what we need for the wallet contract:
1. **State Variables**:
   - `owner`: The address of the wallet owner.
2. **Events**:
   - `Deposit(address sender, uint256 amount)`: Logs deposits.
   - `Withdrawal(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Logs withdrawals.
3. **Functions**:
   - `deposit()`: Accept Ether into the contract.
   - `withdraw(uint256 amount)`: Allow the owner to withdraw.
   - `getBalance()`: Return the contract’s current Ether balance.

### **Your Turn: Write the Pseudocode**
1. Write pseudocode for the wallet contract in the Hardhat project.
2. Start with state variables, events, and basic function signatures.
