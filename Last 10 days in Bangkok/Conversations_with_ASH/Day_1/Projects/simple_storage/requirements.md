Got it! I’ll follow this approach going forward. Let’s start with the **Simple Storage Contract** project.

### **Requirements for Simple Storage Contract**

#### **Step 1: Pseudocode the Plan**
Here’s what we want the contract to achieve:
1. **Store a value**:
   - Users should be able to store a number (`uint`) in the contract.
2. **Retrieve the value**:
   - Users should be able to view the stored number.
3. **Access control**:
   - Only the contract owner can update the stored value.
4. **Emit an event**:
   - Whenever the value is updated, log the new value on the blockchain.

### **Requirement 1: Define State Variables**
Write pseudocode for:
- A variable to store the number (`storedValue`).
- A variable to store the owner's address (`owner`).

Let me know when you’ve written the pseudocode, and we’ll move to the next step!
