- Bonding curves for token launches or community funding.
- On-chain derivatives and options trading systems.
- Flash loans and their use cases (e.g., arbitrage, liquidation).

---

#### **Security and Auditing**
- Reentrancy attacks and complex mitigation strategies.
- Storage collision issues in upgradeable contracts.
- Cross-contract call vulnerabilities (e.g., delegatecall misuse).
- Using fuzzing tools like Echidna for testing.
- Formal verification techniques for smart contracts (e.g., Certora or K Framework).
- Design and implementation of circuit breakers for contract safety.

---

#### **Cryptography and Privacy**
- zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs for zero-knowledge proofs.
- Homomorphic encryption for private computations.
- Multi-party computation (MPC) protocols.
- Verifiable delay functions (VDFs).
- Threshold signatures for decentralized key management.

---

#### **Scaling and Performance**
- Layer 2 scaling solutions:
  - Rollups (Optimistic and ZK Rollups).
  - State channels.
- Sharding techniques and their implications.
- Cross-chain bridges for interoperability.
- Optimizing dApps for high-throughput environments.

#### **Oracles and Off-Chain Data**
- Decentralized oracles like Chainlink:
  - Price feeds, randomness (VRF), and data aggregation.
- Building custom oracles for unique data sources.
- Real-world event triggers using oracles (e.g., insurance contracts).
- Using API3 oracles for transparent API calls.

---

#### **DAO and Governance**
- Quadratic voting systems for equitable governance.
- On-chain vs. off-chain governance models.
- Token-weighted treasury management.
