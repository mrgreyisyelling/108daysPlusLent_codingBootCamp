Great! Let's jump into **Project 4: Gas Tracker**. Here's the plan for this project, which focuses on understanding gas costs by writing functions with varying computational costs.

---

### **Project Objective**
The goal is to explore how different operations affect gas usage, helping you understand optimization and efficiency in Solidity programming.

---

### **Requirements**
1. **Gas-Intensive Function**:
   - Write a function that performs a loop over a large number of iterations.
   - Perform an operation (e.g., summing up numbers or appending to an array) inside the loop.

2. **Lightweight Function**:
   - Write a function that performs a simple arithmetic operation or returns a state variable.

3. **Deployment and Interaction**:
   - Deploy the contract and interact with both functions.
   - Observe gas costs using `ethers.js` or Hardhat's console.

4. **Gas Cost Analysis**:
   - Compare the gas costs of calling each function.
   - Add a third function with intermediate complexity to better visualize the differences.

---

### **Pseudo Code for the Contract**
Below is an abstract outline (no Solidity code, just structure):

1. **State Variables**:
   - `uint256 public simpleVariable;` — For lightweight operations.
   - `uint256[] public gasIntensiveArray;` — For a function requiring more gas.
   - `uint256 public intermediateVariable;` — For intermediate complexity.

2. **Functions**:
   - `setSimpleVariable(uint256 newValue)`:
     - Accepts a value and sets `simpleVariable`.
   - `performGasIntensiveOperation(uint256 iterations)`:
     - Loops `iterations` times, performing an operation (e.g., adding elements to `gasIntensiveArray` or summing numbers).
   - `performIntermediateOperation()`:
     - Computes a mathematical operation or processes a smaller loop.

3. **Events** (optional, for logging results):
   - Emit gas-related details after function execution to aid debugging.

---

### **Contract Outline**
```
// State variables
uint256 public simpleVariable;
uint256[] public gasIntensiveArray;
uint256 public intermediateVariable;

// Lightweight function
function setSimpleVariable(uint256 newValue) public;

// Gas-intensive function
function performGasIntensiveOperation(uint256 iterations) public;

// Intermediate complexity function
function performIntermediateOperation() public;
```

---

### **Deployment and Testing**
1. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Use the same Hardhat deployment pattern you've used for previous projects.

2. **Write a Test Script**:
   - Call each function and measure the gas costs using `tx.gasLimit` or Hardhat’s debug tools.
   - Use different input sizes for the gas-intensive function (e.g., `10`, `1000`, `100000` iterations).

3. **Log the Results**:
   - Capture and print the gas costs for each function.
   - Analyze the results to determine the cost efficiency of each operation.

---

### **Concepts to Keep in Mind**
1. **Gas Optimization**:
   - Gas costs are primarily driven by:
     - Writing to storage (expensive).
     - Loop iterations (cost increases linearly).
     - Function calls.

2. **Scalability**:
   - For large loops, consider moving computation off-chain.
   - Use mappings and arrays efficiently to avoid redundant storage operations.

3. **Testing**:
   - Use controlled environments to simulate gas costs.
   - Analyze edge cases, such as very large inputs or multiple function calls.

To capture and emit gas-related information, you can leverage Solidity's `gasleft()` function. This function returns the amount of gas remaining in the current execution context. By recording the gas before and after running a function, you can calculate and emit the gas used.

Here's how you can enhance your `GasTracker` contract to emit gas usage information:

### Updated Contract with Gas Tracking

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

contract GasTracker {
    event GasUsed(string functionName, uint256 gasUsed);

    function gasHeavy(uint256 seedNumber) public {
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();
        
        uint256 counter = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < seedNumber; i++) {
            counter += i + i + i;
        }

        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();
        emit GasUsed("gasHeavy", gasStart - gasEnd);
    }

    function gasLight(uint256 seedNumber) public {
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();
        
        uint256 result = seedNumber + seedNumber;

        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();
        emit GasUsed("gasLight", gasStart - gasEnd);
    }

    function gasIntermediate(uint256 seedNumber) public {
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();
        
        uint256 result = seedNumber * seedNumber;

        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();
        emit GasUsed("gasIntermediate", gasStart - gasEnd);
    }
}
```

---

### Key Enhancements
1. **Gas Tracking**:
   - Record the gas at the start of the function (`gasStart`).
   - Record the gas remaining at the end of the function (`gasEnd`).
   - Calculate gas used as `gasStart - gasEnd`.

2. **Emit Gas Usage**:
   - Emit an event `GasUsed` with the function name and the gas used during execution.

3. **Events**:
   - Use the `GasUsed` event to log gas information for analysis.

---

### Next Steps
1. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Deploy the contract to a local Hardhat node.

2. **Test the Functions**:
   - Write a script to call each function with varying input sizes (`seedNumber`) and observe the emitted gas usage events.
   - Example test inputs:
     - `gasHeavy(10)`
     - `gasHeavy(1000)`
     - `gasHeavy(100000)`
     - `gasLight(100)`
     - `gasIntermediate(100)`

3. **Analyze Gas Usage**:
   - Use the emitted events to understand the relationship between the complexity of operations and gas costs.

The `receipt.gasUsed.toString()` extracts the gas usage information for a transaction in your testing script. Here’s what it represents and how it’s used:

### What is `receipt.gasUsed`?
- When you execute a transaction on the blockchain, **gas** is consumed based on the computational complexity of the transaction.
- After the transaction is mined, you can get a **transaction receipt**. This receipt contains metadata about the transaction, including the **amount of gas used**.

### Breaking it Down:
1. **Transaction Receipt**: 
   - You obtain it after calling a function on the contract and waiting for the transaction to be mined:
     ```javascript
     const tx = await contract.gasHeavy(seedNumber); // Execute the transaction
     const receipt = await tx.wait(); // Wait for the transaction receipt
     ```

2. **`gasUsed`**:
   - A property of the receipt that gives the amount of gas consumed by the transaction:
     ```javascript
     console.log("Gas Used:", receipt.gasUsed.toString());
     ```
   - It returns a **BigNumber**, which is converted to a string for easy readability using `.toString()`.

### Why Log `gasUsed`?
- To measure and compare the gas efficiency of different functions in your contract.
- Example: Comparing `gasHeavy`, `gasLight`, and `gasIntermediate` in your **GasTracker** contract.

### Example in Context:
```javascript
const tx = await gasTracker.gasHeavy(1000); // Call gas-heavy function
const receipt = await tx.wait(); // Get receipt after mining
console.log("Gas Used for gasHeavy:", receipt.gasUsed.toString());
```

### Key Use:
- Helps you analyze gas consumption for different operations, a critical part of writing cost-effective smart contracts.

The contract you provided does indeed include gas measurement and emits events for the gas used in each function. However, there are a few issues with the code you've posted:

### Issues in the Provided Code

1. **Typographical Errors**:
   - You wrote `unit256` instead of `uint256`. Solidity does not recognize `unit256`.

2. **Event Emission Mistake**:
   - In `gasLight` and `gasIntermediate`, you are emitting the event with `"gasHeavy"` instead of the corresponding function name. This can lead to confusion when interpreting results.

3. **Unused or Missing Variables**:
   - In `gasLight` and `gasIntermediate`, the `seednumber` variable is not properly used. Instead, the variable `seedNumber` is referred to, which may cause an undeclared variable error.

4. **Gas Measurement Logic**:
   - The logic for measuring gas usage is correctly placed, but the gas cost emitted may seem counterintuitive without context (e.g., overhead costs for function calls).

---

### Corrected Code

Here’s an updated and corrected version of your contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

contract GasTracker {
    event GasUsed(string functionName, uint256 gasUsed);

    function gasHeavy(uint256 seedNumber) public {
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();

        uint256 counter = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < seedNumber; i++) {
            counter += i + i + i;
        }

        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();
        emit GasUsed("gasHeavy", gasStart - gasEnd);
    }

    function gasLight(uint256 seedNumber) public {
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();

        uint256 result = seedNumber + seedNumber; // Simpler operation

        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();
        emit GasUsed("gasLight", gasStart - gasEnd);
    }

    function gasIntermediate(uint256 seedNumber) public {
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();

        uint256 result = seedNumber * seedNumber; // Intermediate operation

        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();
        emit GasUsed("gasIntermediate", gasStart - gasEnd);
    }
}
```

---

### Key Changes Made
1. **Fixed Typographical Errors**:
   - Changed `unit256` to `uint256`.

2. **Correct Event Emission**:
   - Updated event emission for `gasLight` and `gasIntermediate` to reflect their actual function names.

3. **Consistent Use of Variables**:
   - Ensured the same variable (`seedNumber`) is consistently used across all functions.

4. **Gas Measurement Placement**:
   - Kept the gas measurement logic intact but clarified the emitted event values.

---

### Next Steps
1. **Testing**:
   - Use your `deploy_gastracker.js` and `test_gastracker.js` scripts to deploy and test this contract.
   - Ensure the emitted events match the expected gas usage for each function.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Compare the gas costs across the three functions to understand why they differ.

3. **Improvement**:
   - Consider adding a function to log the results in a more structured way if needed for further analysis.
