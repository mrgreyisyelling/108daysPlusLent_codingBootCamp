Great! Let's jump into **Project 4: Gas Tracker**. Here's the plan for this project, which focuses on understanding gas costs by writing functions with varying computational costs.

---

### **Project Objective**
The goal is to explore how different operations affect gas usage, helping you understand optimization and efficiency in Solidity programming.

---

### **Requirements**
1. **Gas-Intensive Function**:
   - Write a function that performs a loop over a large number of iterations.
   - Perform an operation (e.g., summing up numbers or appending to an array) inside the loop.

2. **Lightweight Function**:
   - Write a function that performs a simple arithmetic operation or returns a state variable.

3. **Deployment and Interaction**:
   - Deploy the contract and interact with both functions.
   - Observe gas costs using `ethers.js` or Hardhat's console.

4. **Gas Cost Analysis**:
   - Compare the gas costs of calling each function.
   - Add a third function with intermediate complexity to better visualize the differences.

---

### **Pseudo Code for the Contract**
Below is an abstract outline (no Solidity code, just structure):

1. **State Variables**:
   - `uint256 public simpleVariable;` — For lightweight operations.
   - `uint256[] public gasIntensiveArray;` — For a function requiring more gas.
   - `uint256 public intermediateVariable;` — For intermediate complexity.

2. **Functions**:
   - `setSimpleVariable(uint256 newValue)`:
     - Accepts a value and sets `simpleVariable`.
   - `performGasIntensiveOperation(uint256 iterations)`:
     - Loops `iterations` times, performing an operation (e.g., adding elements to `gasIntensiveArray` or summing numbers).
   - `performIntermediateOperation()`:
     - Computes a mathematical operation or processes a smaller loop.

3. **Events** (optional, for logging results):
   - Emit gas-related details after function execution to aid debugging.

---

### **Contract Outline**
```
// State variables
uint256 public simpleVariable;
uint256[] public gasIntensiveArray;
uint256 public intermediateVariable;

// Lightweight function
function setSimpleVariable(uint256 newValue) public;

// Gas-intensive function
function performGasIntensiveOperation(uint256 iterations) public;

// Intermediate complexity function
function performIntermediateOperation() public;
```

---

### **Deployment and Testing**
1. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Use the same Hardhat deployment pattern you've used for previous projects.

2. **Write a Test Script**:
   - Call each function and measure the gas costs using `tx.gasLimit` or Hardhat’s debug tools.
   - Use different input sizes for the gas-intensive function (e.g., `10`, `1000`, `100000` iterations).

3. **Log the Results**:
   - Capture and print the gas costs for each function.
   - Analyze the results to determine the cost efficiency of each operation.

---

### **Concepts to Keep in Mind**
1. **Gas Optimization**:
   - Gas costs are primarily driven by:
     - Writing to storage (expensive).
     - Loop iterations (cost increases linearly).
     - Function calls.

2. **Scalability**:
   - For large loops, consider moving computation off-chain.
   - Use mappings and arrays efficiently to avoid redundant storage operations.

3. **Testing**:
   - Use controlled environments to simulate gas costs.
   - Analyze edge cases, such as very large inputs or multiple function calls.

To capture and emit gas-related information, you can leverage Solidity's `gasleft()` function. This function returns the amount of gas remaining in the current execution context. By recording the gas before and after running a function, you can calculate and emit the gas used.

Here's how you can enhance your `GasTracker` contract to emit gas usage information:

### Updated Contract with Gas Tracking

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

contract GasTracker {
    event GasUsed(string functionName, uint256 gasUsed);

    function gasHeavy(uint256 seedNumber) public {
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();
        
        uint256 counter = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < seedNumber; i++) {
            counter += i + i + i;
        }

        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();
        emit GasUsed("gasHeavy", gasStart - gasEnd);
    }

    function gasLight(uint256 seedNumber) public {
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();
        
        uint256 result = seedNumber + seedNumber;

        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();
        emit GasUsed("gasLight", gasStart - gasEnd);
    }

    function gasIntermediate(uint256 seedNumber) public {
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();
        
        uint256 result = seedNumber * seedNumber;

        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();
        emit GasUsed("gasIntermediate", gasStart - gasEnd);
    }
}
```

---

### Key Enhancements
1. **Gas Tracking**:
   - Record the gas at the start of the function (`gasStart`).
   - Record the gas remaining at the end of the function (`gasEnd`).
   - Calculate gas used as `gasStart - gasEnd`.

2. **Emit Gas Usage**:
   - Emit an event `GasUsed` with the function name and the gas used during execution.

3. **Events**:
   - Use the `GasUsed` event to log gas information for analysis.

---

### Next Steps
1. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Deploy the contract to a local Hardhat node.

2. **Test the Functions**:
   - Write a script to call each function with varying input sizes (`seedNumber`) and observe the emitted gas usage events.
   - Example test inputs:
     - `gasHeavy(10)`
     - `gasHeavy(1000)`
     - `gasHeavy(100000)`
     - `gasLight(100)`
     - `gasIntermediate(100)`

3. **Analyze Gas Usage**:
   - Use the emitted events to understand the relationship between the complexity of operations and gas costs.
