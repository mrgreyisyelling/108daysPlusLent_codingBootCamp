### **Discussion on DAOs and Governance**

#### **Governance in Web3**
- Governance in blockchain refers to decision-making processes involving:
  1. **On-chain governance**:
     - Decisions are made and executed via smart contracts.
     - Transparent and automated (e.g., vote results trigger fund disbursements).
  2. **Off-chain governance**:
     - Discussions and proposals are made externally (e.g., forums like Discourse).
     - Votes can happen off-chain, with results implemented manually or by multi-sigs.

#### **What Are DAOs?**
- **Definition**:
  - DAOs are smart contract-based organizations where decisions are made collectively by token holders or members.
- **Core Features**:
  1. **Decentralization**:
     - No central authority; power is distributed.
  2. **Transparency**:
     - All actions (votes, fund allocation) are visible on-chain.
  3. **Automation**:
     - Governance and operational rules are encoded in smart contracts.

#### **Example DAO Models**
1. **Protocol DAOs** (e.g., MakerDAO, Uniswap):
   - Govern protocol upgrades and tokenomics.
2. **Investment DAOs** (e.g., PleasrDAO):
   - Pool funds for investments.
3. **Service DAOs** (e.g., Raid Guild):
   - Operate as decentralized consulting or development firms.
4. **Social/Community DAOs** (e.g., Friends with Benefits):
   - Foster shared interests or communities.

### **Project 3: Voting System**

#### **Core Concepts**
- Proposals and votes are tracked via mappings.
- Events provide transparency and traceability.
- Ownership ensures only authorized users can create proposals.

#### **Starting Requirements**
1. `mapping(uint => uint)` to track votes for proposals.
2. `mapping(address => mapping(uint => bool))` to track user participation.
3. Functions:
   - `createProposal(string memory description)`: Owner-only function to create proposals.
   - `vote(uint proposalId)`: Allows users to vote.
   - `getVotes(uint proposalId)`: Returns the total votes for a proposal.

---

### **Project 4: Gas Tracker**

#### **Core Concepts**
- Computationally heavy vs. lightweight operations.
- Analyzing and optimizing gas usage.
- Storage vs. memory costs.

#### **Starting Requirements**
1. Write two functions:
   - **Gas-intensive**:
     - Loop-based computation (e.g., summing numbers in an array).
   - **Light operation**:
     - Simple arithmetic (e.g., adding two numbers).
2. Deploy and interact to observe gas usage.
3. Log and compare gas costs.

### **Letâ€™s Begin**
1. **Kick-off Project 3**:
   - Start with requirements and goal discussion.
   - Gradually implement features.
2. **Shift to Project 4**:
   - After completing Project 3, transition to exploring gas mechanics.
